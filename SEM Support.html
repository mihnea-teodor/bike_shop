<div id="text33">
<p><strong>What size bike is right for me?</strong><br>
Trying out several bikes in person will help you find the best fit for your height, body type and riding style, as everyone has different preferences in terms of fit.<p>
<br>
<p><strong>Where can I find the serial number on my bike?</strong><br>
Your serial number is located under the bottom bracket shell. Take a moment and write this number down. You may need it for reference in the event that you require theft insurance.</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Will you sponsor me?</strong><br>
We're not currently accepting sponsorship requests.</p>
